# Express.js Route Handler Missing Robust Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: insufficient error handling.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that doesn't handle cases where a user ID is invalid or a user is not found. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes in the application. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.

## Bug

The original code lacks error handling for invalid or missing user IDs.  If the user attempts to access a user with an invalid ID or a non-existent user, the application will either return a 404 with insufficient detail or crash unexpectedly (depending on how the `users` array is structured).

## Solution

The solution adds comprehensive error handling to address these scenarios.  It checks whether the requested user ID is a valid number and whether a user with that ID exists. If not, it sends a more informative 404 error response to the client, improving user experience and application stability.
